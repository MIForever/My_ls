# Welcome to My Ls
***

## Task
Every single sign is challenging there.

## Description
I take almost a week to complete this project. And there weren't to sort names of folders too.

## Installation
Nothing to install. It is like the ls command in Linux.

## Usage
It is the same as the ls command in Linux but it is available only with -t, -a, and -ta options.
```
./my_ls [args]
```
