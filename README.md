# Welcome to My Ls
This was insanely hard!

## Task
Every single sing is challanging there.

## Description
I take almost a week to complete this project. And there weren't to sort names of folders too.

## Installation
Nothing to install. It is like ls command in linux.

## Usage
It is the same as ls command in linux but it is avaliable only -t, -a and -ta options.
```
./my_project argument1 argument2
```
